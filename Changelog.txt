- Fixed bugs with MoveableGamePiece child constructors
- Added IsColliding() method to GamePiece that takes another GamePiece and checks to see if their sprites are colliding
- Commented out duplicate SpriteHeight property in Sprite.cs
- BUG: Sprite Draw method is trying to override Draw from something else but there's nothing there to override, so I commented it out for now.

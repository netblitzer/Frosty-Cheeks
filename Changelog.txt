	- Meter
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joh 3/19/15

- Added constructors to MoveableGamePiece, Player and GamePiece
- Added method stubs to Player class for Jump, HitObstacle and PlayAnimation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luke 3-27-15
- Frame.cs
	- InitializeFrames() method for creating all the frames
	- Constructor (will) grab a random frame and make random obstacles
	- Position, Obstacles, enum properties
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joh 3/30/15
- Fixed bugs with MoveableGamePiece child constructors
- Added IsColliding() method to GamePiece that takes another GamePiece and checks to see if their sprites are colliding
- Commented out duplicate SpriteHeight property in Sprite.cs
- BUG: Sprite Draw method is trying to override Draw from something else but there's nothing there to override, so I commented it out for now.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
JordON 4/1/15
-Only worked on Game.cs
-Sir Issac Newton is now our player, haha
-Player moves and jumps
-Temporary Obstacle moves towards the player
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luke 4- 1,2,3 -15
- Frame.cs
	- Filled out the constructors
	- Reading frames in is nearly completely done
	- Able to randomize and choose from several frames
- Game.cs
	- Working frames reading in
	- Obstacles reading off frames
- Frame Builder
	- Fresh build
	- Randomly spawns objects when you click to place them
	- Saves frames to be used
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joh 4-13
- Fixed incorect bounding box locations
- Removed crowded frames and replaced them with one frame, with one obstacle for easier testing
- Linked cold meter in Game.cs to player.Tempurature
- Moved constant downward change in tempurature to player.cs 
- Set new starting tempurature to start at one end of the tempurature meter
- Added methods to change shorts length on contact with powerups
- Added DBX ascii art to comments ;)
- Cleaned up code in Player.cs
- Added method stub for CalculateTempurate (will complete later tonight)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
JordON 4/16
- Changed the HypoMeter, the meter now increases, filling in the blue part
- Game will end upon reaching 100% of meter ~JOH asked me to comment it out due to bugs
- ScoreScreen will be displayed upon end game ~Also commented out due to bugs
- Need to implement binary file for displaying and storing highscores (names will not be included)
- There is a Dev Kill key for testing purposes. This key is Q
- Did a small tidbit of cleanup
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joh 4-16
- Added PowerupSpawner class which is instantiated in Game.cs. It spawns in powerups after semi-random lengths of time.
- Added standin art for longer shorts powerups and shorter shorts powerup
- Powerups move to the right (at an arbitrary speed for now; player speed doesn't seem to sync up correctly)
- Set up basework for Powerup collisions similarly to obstacle collisions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
JordON 4/17
- The end game logic now works
- Game resets on hitting Start button, allowing the game to be played countless times
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joh 4-19
- Added SmallObstacle, MediumObstacle and LargeObstacle stub classes to help with FrameBuilder stuff
- Powerups spawn off screen and scroll across with the same speed as background and obstacles
- Powerups spawn 
- Cleaned up some of the older change log posts
- Powerups spawn at random 5 - 15 second intervals
- TODO: Powerups do not collide with / effect the player -- will fix
- TODO: Powerups do not despawn when they are off the screen -- will fix
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joh 4-21
- Fixed issue with collisions where Frame stuff in Game.cs was only updating its obstacles' sprite position but not its object position
- This ^ fix got powerup collisions working
- Moved collision logic to its own method in Game.cs
- Player's change in temperature is now effected by colliding with powerups
- Powerups dissapear when player collides with them
- Added method in GamePiece to display all GamePieces' bounding boxes in red 
- Found out that the reason collisions are getting triggered early is because of the empty space surrounding the Newton sprite.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
JordON 4/23
- Score screen is fully functional
- We can change the location of what's on the screen at any time
- Do I have added a .dat file and a blank text file for highscores
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luke 4-29-15
- Frame.cs
	- Fixed it to new standards
- Frame Builder ¡COMPLETED!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
JordON 4/30
- I did shit and stuff #frustration
- Added an int for obs type, get over it or tell me why you actually need separate classes
- You cannot use folders to allow people to include their own textures
- Fixed code to implement new dev art (moving obstacle creates a GIANT black bar vertically downward)
- Obstacles are either at a incorrect resolution or have incorrect coordinates (probably both)
- I hate life
- Removed some commented out stuff (clean up)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
John 4/30
- Fixed bounding box not moving with player during jumps
	- Player movement now totally uses spritePosition instead of GamePiece's position
- player.Position is pretty much obsolete now. But we're going to leave it ther anyway because fuck logic.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
JordON 4/30
- I have fit the bounding box closer to the player
- I have resized the Normal Obstacle to half of player's size 
	- We can change the scale once our actual player is done
- On the editor I have fixed the obstacles positions to the player's relative position
	- Also can be changed once we have our actual player
- Implemented use of wind tunnels / warm zones (no temperature effect yet, will do tomorrow in GDAPS)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
JordON 4/30
- Wind tunnels and warm zones have temperature effects (balancing needed)
- Implemented 2 means of temperature on top of John's original
	- These are found in the "Different Modes Folder", each labeled what it's being calculated on
	- My third mode will need a bit of effort to formulate and write up so for now it is on hold
- No changes to the main file, only to my copies, and please don't edit or delete them
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
JordON 5/6
- The main Frost Cheeks file is now fully updated with the ability to add your own textures as a user
- **NOTE** The main Content folder is deleted. The main content folder is now deleted, please add your 
  files to the Content folder in bin\WindowsGL\Debug\Content. Please also add them to the corresponding 
  folders. Any assets that aren't an object or frame, place inside "Needed Textures".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ethan the Fuckbeast 5/7
- Made the fucking game goddamn work in player.

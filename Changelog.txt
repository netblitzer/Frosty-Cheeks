V1 - Initial Release
	- Project Created
	- MethodsLibrary Impelemented
		- Clamps (int, double, float, Vector2)

Joh 3-15-15
Added basic object and character classes:
- Powerup
	- LongerPowerup
	- ShorterPowerup
	- SuperSaiyan

		- Obstacle
		- Player

Added basic fields with properties to several classes
- Powerup.cs
	-float strength
- GamePiece.cs
	- Vector2 globalPosition
	- Vector2 localPosition (We'll have to talk about whether we still want to use this)
- MoveableGamePiece.cs
	- float speed
- Player.cs
	- float Tempurature
	- float shorts length

Have a happy day!

- GUIObject
	- Button
	- Slider
	- Meter
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joh 3/19/15
- Added float speed and Vector2 velocity to MoveableGamepiece.cs
- Added constructors to MoveableGamePiece, Player and GamePiece
- Added method stubs to Player class for Jump, HitObstacle and PlayAnimation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luke 3-27-15
- Frame.cs
	- InitializeFrames() method for creating all the frames
	- Constructor (will) grab a random frame and make random obstacles
	- Position, Obstacles, enum properties
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joh 3/30/15
- Fixed bugs with MoveableGamePiece child constructors
- Added IsColliding() method to GamePiece that takes another GamePiece and checks to see if their sprites are colliding
- Commented out duplicate SpriteHeight property in Sprite.cs
- BUG: Sprite Draw method is trying to override Draw from something else but there's nothing there to override, so I commented it out for now.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
JordON 4/1/15
-Only worked on Game.cs
-Sir Issac Newton is now our player, haha
-Player moves and jumps
-Temporary Obstacle moves towards the player
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luke 4- 1,2,3 -15
- Frame.cs
	- Filled out the constructors
	- Reading frames in is nearly completely done
	- Able to randomize and choose from several frames
- Game.cs
	- Working frames reading in
	- Obstacles reading off frames
- Frame Builder
	- Fresh build
	- Randomly spawns objects when you click to place them
	- Saves frames to be used
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joh 4-13
- Fixed incorect bounding box locations
- Removed crowded frames and replaced them with one frame, with one obstacle for easier testing
- Linked cold meter in Game.cs to player.Tempurature
- Moved constant downward change in tempurature to player.cs 
- Set new starting tempurature to start at one end of the tempurature meter
- Added methods to change shorts length on contact with powerups
- Added DBX ascii art to comments ;)
- Cleaned up code in Player.cs
- Added method stub for CalculateTempurate (will complete later tonight)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
JordON 4/16
- Changed the HypoMeter, the meter now increases, filling in the blue part
- Game will end upon reaching 100% of meter ~JOH asked me to comment it out due to bugs
- ScoreScreen will be displayed upon end game ~Also commented out due to bugs
- Need to implement binary file for displaying and storing highscores (names will not be included)
- There is a Dev Kill key for testing purposes. This key is Q
- Did a small tidbit of cleanup
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joh 4-16
- Added PowerupSpawner class which is instantiated in Game.cs. It spawns in powerups after semi-random lengths of time.
- Added standin art for longer shorts powerups and shorter shorts powerup
- Powerups move to the right (at an arbitrary speed for now; player speed doesn't seem to sync up correctly)
- Set up basework for Powerup collisions similarly to obstacle collisions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
JordON 4/17
- The end game logic now works
- Game resets on hitting Start button, allowing the game to be played countless times
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joh 4-19
- Added SmallObstacle, MediumObstacle and LargeObstacle stub classes to help with FrameBuilder stuff
- Powerups spawn off screen and scroll across with the same speed as background and obstacles
- Powerups spawn 
- Cleaned up some of the older change log posts
- Powerups spawn at random 5 - 15 second intervals
- TODO: Powerups do not collide with / effect the player -- will fix
- TODO: Powerups do not despawn when they are off the screen -- will fix
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joh 4-21
- Fixed issue with collisions where Frame stuff in Game.cs was only updating its obstacles' sprite position but not its object position
- This ^ fix got powerup collisions working
- Moved collision logic to its own method in Game.cs
- Player's change in temperature is now effected by colliding with powerups
- Powerups dissapear when player collides with them
- Added method in GamePiece to display all GamePieces' bounding boxes in red 
- Found out that the reason collisions are getting triggered early is because of the empty space surrounding the Newton sprite.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
JordON 4/23
- Score screen is fully functional
- We can change the location of what's on the screen at any time
- Do I have added a .dat file and a blank text file for highscores
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luke 4-29-15
- Frame.cs
	- Fixed it to new standards
- Frame Builder ¡COMPLETED!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
